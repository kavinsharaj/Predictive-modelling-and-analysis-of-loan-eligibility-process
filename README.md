‘Predictive modelling and analysis of loan eligibility process’is the project 
we are working upon which falls under the BFSI domain (Banking Financial 
services and Insurance sector). Based on customer detail provided while filling 
online application form,the data set has details like Gender, Marital Status, 
Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and 
others. The primary purpose of working on this project is to build the model to 
automate the initial loan process.
1.2Need of the Study 
Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on 
customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are 
Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, 
Credit History and others. To automate this process, they have given a problem to 
identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can 
specifically target these customers.

data are collected by the respective companies based on details provided by the 
company while filling the application

1.4 Business Model of Enterprise 
Selecting the relevant variables from the dataset and arranging their values in 
order of importance to create a models to predict the probability of loan status of 
an individual in the future by performing different types of algorithm
